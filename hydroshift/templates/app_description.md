**HydroShift** is a tool for exploring streamflow trends in USGS gage data.  This web app
provides interactive plots of annual peak discharge, seasonality of flood peaks, and daily and monthly discharge
trends. Beyond data summary, the application includes a statistical changepoint analysis that will detect when
significant changes in the distribution of flood peaks have occurred.
